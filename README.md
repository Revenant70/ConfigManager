Welcome to the ConfigManager, an application designed to simplify the storage and management of configurations. This README will guide you through the features and usage of the Configuration Manager.
Features

- Store Configurations: Save configurations in formatted text format.
- View Configurations: Easily view stored configurations.
- Edit Configurations: Make changes to configurations as needed.

# Usage

Adding a Configuration:
- Click on the "Plus" button.
- Enter or paste the configuration text into the provided field.

Viewing Configurations:
- All stored configurations will be listed in the dashboard.
- Click on a configuration to view its contents in detail.

Editing Configurations:
- Click on the "Edit" button next to a configuration.
- Make your changes to the configuration text.
- Save the changes.

# Example

Suppose you have a nginx.conf file containing the configuration for an NGINX web server. Instead of managing it as a file on your system, you can copy the contents of the file and paste it into the Configuration Manager. This allows you to access and modify the configuration from any device with internet access, providing convenience and flexibility.
